RETROSPECTIVE (Team 2)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 4 - 4
- Total points committed vs. done 26-26
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 72 - 71.45

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#5_Describe_hut   |   4      |  5     |  8h          |     8h30m         |
| _#6_Describe_parking      |     4    |   5     |       8h     |   9h           |
| _#7_Search_hut      |  4       |   8     |        13h    |    14h15m          |
| _#8_Link_start/arrival      |   3      |  8      |     8h       |     5h30m         |
   

- Hours per task average (estimate and actual): 
37/15= 2.47; 37.25/15= 2.48 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: 
- 37/37.25 -> 1 - 0.99 = 0.01

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 4h30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 21
  
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 3h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

While planning we did not seperate the tasks for unit tests and integration tests; Overall, We did better estimations in this sprint. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

By simplifying the tasks, the quality of the process of estimation increased; Better planning leads to better work.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able  to achieve? 

Better coordination with the team members;  
Better planning;
Improved division of the work between group
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

While estimating, we didnâ€™t considered the time to fix bugs and test the code again.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

Separation of the tasks regarding Integration and Unit Test
Cleaner code and improved quality in backend and frontend 


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We did a good team work

The team is in good spirit
